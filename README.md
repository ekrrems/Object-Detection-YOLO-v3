# Object-Detection-YOLO-v3
In this repo you will find how to detect objects on image and video using YOLO v3

This project i tried to detect objects on an image including a woman and a laptop and a video with cars passing. I achieved to detect almost everything on these inputs.

<h3>You can use the same code to detect other things. You can find the things that you can detect in the yolo-coco-data/coco.names file.</h3>
